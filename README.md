With the Scholar Navi app you can browse and visualise the data from
Google Scholar. The app is written in R/Shiny and takes advantage of the
[scholar](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scholar/index.html) R
package.

The app displays:

- the citation history of a researcher,
- the citation history of researcherâ€™s top publications,
- the co-author network,
- the citation history of a collection of papers (stored in a Google
  Docs spreadsheet),
- a comparison between researchers.

## Installation

like so:

``` r

devtools::install_github("dmattek/shiny-scholar-navi")
